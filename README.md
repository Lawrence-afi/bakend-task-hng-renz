## Overview
This is a minimalist Node.js Express backend service designed to provide personal information combined with a random cat fact fetched from an external API. It incorporates essential features like CORS handling and API rate limiting for robust performance.

## Features
- **Express.js**: Powers the robust and efficient API server.
- **Axios**: Handles asynchronous HTTP requests for fetching external data.
- **CORS**: Manages Cross-Origin Resource Sharing for secure frontend integration.
- **Express-Rate-Limit**: Implements request throttling to prevent abuse and ensure service stability.

## Getting Started

To get this project up and running on your local machine, follow these simple steps.

### Installation

1.  üì• **Clone the Repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Lawrence-afi/bakend-task-hng-renz.git
    cd bakend-task-hng-renz
    ```

2.  üì¶ **Install Dependencies**:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  üöÄ **Start the Server**:
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```
    The server will start on `http://localhost:3000`. You will see "Server is running on port 3000" in your console.

### Environment Variables
No environment variables are currently required for this project.

## API Documentation

### Base URL
`http://localhost:3000` (for local development)

### Endpoints

#### GET /me
Retrieves personalized user information along with a random cat fact.

**Request**:
This endpoint does not require any request body or query parameters.

**Response**:
```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "user": {
    "email": "lawrenceikara@gmail.com",
    "name": "Lawrence Ikara Okon ",
    "stack": "Node.js/Express"
  },
  "timestamp": "2023-10-27T12:00:00.000Z",
  "fact": "Cats can jump up to six times their height."
}
```

**Errors**:
- `500 Internal Server Error`: An error occurred while fetching the cat fact or processing the request.

## Usage

Once the server is running, you can access the `/me` endpoint using any HTTP client (e.g., your browser, Postman, curl).

To test the endpoint:

1.  Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000/me`.
2.  Alternatively, use `curl` from your terminal:
    ```bash
    curl http://localhost:3000/me
    ```
    You should receive a JSON response containing the user details and a cat fact.

## Key Features

*   **Personalized Profile**: Serves static personal information quickly.
*   **External API Integration**: Seamlessly fetches dynamic content from the Cat Fact API.
*   **API Rate Limiting**: Protects the endpoint from excessive requests, ensuring fair usage and stability.
*   **CORS Enabled**: Configured to allow cross-origin requests, making it easy to integrate with frontend applications.
